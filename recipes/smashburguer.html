    <h1>Smash Burguer</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A thin, juicy burger ready in minutes. Homemade smash burgers are totally possible—and we'll show you how. The
        result? A crispy crust on the outside, juicy meat on the inside, and zero hassle shaping the burger.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>160g ground flank steak (with fat)</li>
        <li>2 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>2 slices of prato cheese (or your preferred cheese)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <Li>Black pepper</Li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, knead the meat with your hands and shape it into two 80g balls. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Cut the buns in half and spread a thin layer of butter on the inside of each half. Heat a large nonstick
            skillet over medium heat. Place the buns buttered side down and brown for 30 seconds—this is very quick,
            just enough to toast them without letting the bread get tough. Set the buns aside on a plate.</li>
        <li>Keep the skillet over medium heat and drizzle with ½ teaspoon of olive oil. Place a portion of the meat and
            press with a spatula to form a very thin patty. Season with salt and pepper and brown the first side. Repeat
            with the other portion.</li>
        <li>Using the spatula, flip the burgers and season the other side with another pinch of salt. Let brown for
            about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Top each burger with a slice of cheese, spray the skillet with water, and cover—the steam from the water
            helps the cheese melt. Leave covered for about 1 minute, or until the cheese melts..</li>
        <li>Transfer the burgers to the buns and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You can vary the layout and create new flavor combinations by adding tomato, sliced lettuce, or pickles. Since
        the smash burger is so thin, you can even make a sandwich with two burgers...</p>
